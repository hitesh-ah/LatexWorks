\begin{altverse}
\incipit{I roved by the seashore},\\*
in search of shells in those mossy rocks\\*
And would have slipped my legs if\\*
it wasn't for a stranger near me.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
"Hey Boy, watch your steps,\\*
These rocks aren't for you to climb!"\\*
Out of sight I had to smile,\\*
While the grip was firm
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
"Whose would it be ?"\\*
The question was foolish;\\*
"Look upon your feet", he said\\*
"And show me your path"!
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
The sands had cleared followed my toes,\\*
but his eyes where upon the seashore\\*
There was nothing in the way\\*
as the sight of gloaming sun.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
Footprints on the seashore\\*
all have vanished,\\*
Disperse out of sight\\*
under the smiling sun.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
The man had a witty smile,\\*
The beauty that around you lies,\\*
The misty loveliness of the dusk,\\*
In those eyes, there was certainty\\*
\end{altverse}
\\
\begin{altverse}
Having a déjà vu\\*
in hearing his words,\\*
The man must be a saint\\*
Enlightened clarity of thoughts\\*
Should it be a lead\\*
had we ever noticed..\\*
\end{altverse}
\\
\begin{altverse}
As i watch him walk away\\*
With those tides nearby,\\*
The open sea waves more\\*
into our life.\\*
Sailing on the sand\\*
Looks upon your feet.\\*
\end{altverse}
